# MotivationalTaskList
A first crack at a Material Design Android application. Currently WIP, working on these features:

- ~~User-defined order~~ and priority/tags

Possible features in the far future:
- Custom user theme (primary/secondary colors)
- Animations (mostly done thanks to DragListView)
- Google Calendar integration
- Voice, image memo
- Long-term goal of adding some 'assistant' (similar to MS Word 2003's paperclip) as a companion, 
  with system similar to Todoist's karma as motivation
