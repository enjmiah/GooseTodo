# MotivationalTaskList
My first crack at a Material Design Android application. Currently WIP, working on these features:

- User-created tasks with due dates; user-defined order and priority/tags

- Google Calendar integration
- Voice, image memo
- Long-term goal of adding some 'assistant' (similar to MS Word 2003's paperclip) as a companion, 
  with system similar to Todoist's karma as motivation
